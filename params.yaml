INCLUDE_TOP: False # removing those final layers and keeping only the feature extractor (convolutional part)
EPOCHS: 2 #200 300
CLASSES: 2 #binary classification.
WEIGHTS: imagenet #using transfer learning â†’ load pretrained weights from ImageNet. Instead of training from scratch, the model already knows low-level features (edges, textures, shapes).
